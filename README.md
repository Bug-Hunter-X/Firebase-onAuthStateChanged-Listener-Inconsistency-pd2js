# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in the Firebase Authentication SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener.  Under certain circumstances, particularly with asynchronous operations or race conditions, the listener may not reliably trigger when the user's authentication status changes.

The `authBug.js` file reproduces the issue, while `authSolution.js` provides a solution using promises to handle asynchronous operations effectively and ensure the listener always reflects the correct authentication state.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Firebase using `npm install firebase`.
3. Configure Firebase in `authBug.js` (replace placeholders with your project details).
4. Run `authBug.js` and observe the inconsistent behavior.
5. Run `authSolution.js` to see how the problem is solved. 

This issue underscores the importance of careful handling of asynchronous operations when interacting with Firebase Authentication.

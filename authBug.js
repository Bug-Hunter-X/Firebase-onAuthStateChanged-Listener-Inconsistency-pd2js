The Firebase Authentication SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger when the user's authentication state changes due to a race condition or asynchronous operation. This can lead to a situation where the app's UI doesn't reflect the current user's authentication status, potentially causing unexpected behavior or security issues.  For example, the app might show a login screen even though the user is already logged in, or it might fail to update the UI when the user logs out.
